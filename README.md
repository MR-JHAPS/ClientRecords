ClientRecords Application

Java
Spring Boot
Swagger
JWT
HATEOAS
Logback

ClientRecords is a robust Spring Boot application designed to manage client records with role-based access control. It provides functionalities for user management, client operations, and advanced search capabilities. The application is secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and implements role-based authorization to ensure secure access to resources.
‚ú® Key Features

    Role-Based Access Control: Admins can manage users and clients, update roles, and perform CRUD operations.

    JWT Authentication: Secure authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.

    Advanced Search: Search clients by firstName, lastName, postalCode, or any custom query.

    Pagination & Sorting: Supports pagination and sorting using HATEOAS and Pageable.

    Custom Exceptions: Handles exceptions globally with custom error responses.

    Logging: Integrated with SLF4J and Logback for detailed logging.

    Swagger API Documentation: Auto-generated API documentation for easy testing and integration.

    DTOs & Mappers: Uses DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and mappers for clean data handling.

    PreAuthorize: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights
1. Spring Security with JWT

    Implemented JWT-based authentication and authorization.

    Configured Spring Security to restrict access based on user roles.

    Used @PreAuthorize to enforce role-based access at the method level.

2. Advanced Search Functionality

    Built a flexible search mechanism in ClientSearchController to query clients by:

        firstName

        lastName

        postalCode

        Any custom query.

3. Pagination & Sorting

    Implemented pagination and sorting using Spring Data JPA and HATEOAS.

    Created a utility class SortBuilder to dynamically generate sorting criteria:
    java
    Copy

    public static Sort createSorting(String direction, String sortBy) {
        if (sortBy == null || direction == null) {
            return null;
        }
        Sort.Direction sortDirection = direction.equalsIgnoreCase("asc") ? Sort.Direction.ASC : Sort.Direction.DESC;
        return Sort.by(sortDirection, sortBy);
    }

4. Global Exception Handling

    Implemented a GlobalExceptionHandler to handle exceptions globally.

    Returned consistent API responses using ApiResponseModel:
    json
    Copy

    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
      "message": "Error message",
      "status": 400,
      "data": null
    }

5. Logging

    Integrated SLF4J with Logback for detailed logging.

    Configured logging in logback.xml to log to both console and file.

6. Swagger API Documentation

    Configured Swagger to auto-generate API documentation.

    Accessible at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
